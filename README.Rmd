# An example SEIR compartmental model implemented in stan

> [There are many like it, but this one is mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed)

An example SEIR model implemented in stan for the CMMID computational and inference theme meeting. 

## What

> Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. Thousands of users rely on Stan for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business.
>
>Users specify log density functions in Stan’s probabilistic programming language and get:
>
> - full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling (NUTS, HMC)
> - approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference (ADVI)
> - penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization (L-BFGS)
>
> Stan’s math library provides differentiable probability functions & linear algebra (C++ autodiff). Additional R packages provide expression-based linear modeling, posterior visualization, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

See [here](https://mc-stan.org) for more. 

## Why

- Community, documention, and ongoing development.
- A good enough tool for a broad range of problems. Useful if wanting to do anything other than compartmental models.
- Clean domain-specific langauge (DSL) which can be extended with functions written in C++.
- Largely automated and optimised MCMC reduces the cognitive load when modelling.
- Number of stan users in the CMMID who are likely willing to help.

## Why not

- MCMC often not a great choice for complex compartmental model systems. For these models tools that support PMCMC or SMC^2 are likely more optimal (Libbi/Birch, ODIN/Dust, etc). 
- Not likely to be widely used by many supervisors and so may be difficult to get code support. 
- Hard to use programmatically across models (you may find yourself writing a DSL generator).
- Interaction with fit model objects is not currently ideal but this is an area of work in the community (and the situation is much better than for other tools).

## Example

### Set up

* Load some packages

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(rstan)
library(tidyverse)
```

* Load the SEIR model (heavily based on [Bayesian workflow for disease transmission modelling in stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/boarding_school_case_study.html)).


```{r}
model <- stan_model("model.stan")
model
```

* Load the data

```{r}
# Cases
dt <- readRDS("data/SIRsample.rds")
head(dt)
```

* Look at the simulated data  - oh dear.

```{r}
plot(dt$onsets)
```

* Define as parameters for the stan model

```{r}
data <- list(
  cases = dt$onsets,
  n_days = length(dt$onsets),
  t0 = 0,
  tswitch = 10,
  N = 1e5
)
data$ts <- seq(1, data$n_days, by = 1)
```

### Fit the model


* Fit the model using NUTS - this won't actually fit probably due to model misspecification but maybe also user error...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fit_nuts <- sampling(model,
                     data = data,
                     chains = 4,
                     seed = 0)
```

This model is likely not a very good fit for this data. There are low case numbers meaning that stochasticity is probably an issue and onsets are very stable initially and then peak well before susceptibility depletion looks like it would play a role. Some things we could explore to deal with this: 

- different priors choices.
- time-varying beta and importations.
- importations, sub-critical R, and a stochastic model. 
- assuming a high level of underreporting combined with importations.
- lots of other things to explore.

At this point I decided to have a BBQ instead (see below and note the natty hat). See resources for more information about stan and compartmental models. If interested in more of my cutting insights I'm available for collaboration.
